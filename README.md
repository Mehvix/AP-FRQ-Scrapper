## AP-FRQ-Scrapper

### What
`main.py` will request webscrape any Collegeboard coarse overview URL and download all avaliable FRQ pdfs.

### Why
1. Collegeboard has removed content before.
2. I have an AP test resource repo on [cloud.mehvix.com](https://cloud.mehvix.com) and I wanna merge ~~leaked~~ MCQs with FRQs for full mocks.

### How
Running `main.py` will prompt you to enter the a course's previous exams URL, this should look something like:
> [https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/[exam-name]/exam/past-exam-questions/]()
